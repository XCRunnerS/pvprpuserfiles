This is a gist about reducing the amount of ads and data pvprp can collect on you.

## Site settings

make sure pvprp has the following settings:

chrome: click [here](chrome://settings/content/siteDetails?site=https%3A%2F%2Fpvprp.com)

setting | value
-|-
location | block
camera | block
mic | block
sensors | block
**`javascript`** | `allow`* NEEDED
**`images`** | `allow` * VERY IMPORTANT
popups* | `block` *extra useful using my userscript
ads* | block* this doesnt block most ads

## extensions/browsers

### browsers

as a basic guide, use [brave](https://brave.com/), [operagx](https://www.opera.com/gx), or [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)*(get an adblocker)

there are also some recommended `extensions` for these browsers;

extension + chrome link | description | firefox link
-|-|-
[Adguard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg) | blocks a significant amount of ads, custom filters, HIGHLY recommended. | [firefox link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adguard-adblocker/)
[Ghostery](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery-%E2%80%93-privacy-ad-blo/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij) | slightly better adblock in terms of what isnt blocked | [firefox link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghostery/)
ublock origin | I havent used this one | search
